Project: Implementation of the paper titled 'Bridging the Domain Gap: A Simple Domain Matching Method for Reference-Based Image Super-Resolution in Remote Sensing' published in IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS, VOL. 21, 2024 authored by Jeongho Min et al.

Description of the work - 
As per the paper, the domain matching module is integrated with the baseline model of DATSR. As shown in paper, the three algorithms DATSR, C2-Matching and AMSA are used as baseline model for integration of the proposed Domain Matching mmodule. Out of these three models, the DATSR turns out to be best performing algorithm
